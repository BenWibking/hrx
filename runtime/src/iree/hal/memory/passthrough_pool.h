// Creates a pass-through pool that delegates every reservation directly to the
// slab provider. Each acquired reservation owns a new slab. After the token and
// views return, its exact release frontier is joined before native release on
// the captured maintenance owner. A failed prerequisite quarantines the slab
// until caller-quiescent pool destruction and is reported by later acquisition.
// With an empty release frontier, prior uses are already complete and sanitizer
// marking finishes before release returns. With pending history, marking is
// deferred with native retirement. Native freeing is always asynchronous.
// With DISALLOW_GROWTH, acquisition returns EXHAUSTED/GROWTH_REQUIRED without
// acquiring backing or transaction metadata. With growth enabled, native
// acquisition and rollback run on the captured maintenance owner; the caller
// joins that cold work outside its submission critical section. This never
// waits for another allocation to release capacity.
//
// This is the simplest possible pool. It provides the same behavior as direct
// allocation through the current iree_hal_allocator_t and serves as a baseline
// for benchmarking suballocating pool types.
//
// |slab_provider| is retained for the lifetime of the pool.
// |maintenance| is retained and shared with other pools in the memory domain.
// Final destruction joins only this pool's maintenance after the caller has
// retired its execution. Destruction runs outside that owner's executor.
// |notification| is retained for the lifetime of the pool, published
// on reservation release, and skips wake work when no waiter is observing it.
// |host_allocator| is used for pool metadata, reservation state, and
// materialization transaction state.
// The pool borrows |frontier_tracker| for reservation reuse dependencies. Its
// owning group must outlive the pool and all operations using it.
