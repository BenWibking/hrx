// Transient buffer: a reservation handle for queue-ordered Vulkan allocations.
//
// Queue allocators can return a transient buffer to the caller before the
// physical backing is ready, then commit a real backing buffer once queue
// ordering allows it. queue_dealloca can later decommit the wrapper while the
// transient buffer object itself remains live so stale host references fail
// cleanly with IREE_STATUS_FAILED_PRECONDITION instead of accessing freed
// storage.
