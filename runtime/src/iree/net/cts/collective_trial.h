// entire reduced tensor after each round. Subsequent rounds depend on that
// check.
//
// Pipeline stages receive a whole activation before computing a deterministic
// transform and sending their output. Bounded microbatch slots allow overlap;
// output reuse joins its exact source callbacks independently of peer input
// consumption. Message blocks assemble into application-owned stage inputs;
// registered blocks land directly there. The final stage checks its entire
// output and returns completion to rank zero over a control-only connection.

// Registered mode places into reusable application inputs without message
// staging. Message mode consumes the transport's actual receive leases. Only
// bootstrap, phase joins and errors use cross-thread state outside the net
// APIs. Setup, warm-up and teardown are excluded from timing; host reduction,
// validation, progress feedback and every source callback are included.

// a measurement of multi-host topology, isolated wire latency or link
