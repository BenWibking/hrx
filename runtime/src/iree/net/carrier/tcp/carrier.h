// TCP carrier implementing reliable ordered byte-stream transport.
//
// One logical send owns the ordered socket write lane at a time. Once all its
// bytes are accepted, a zero-copy send may await source retirement in its own
// bounded slot while the next send starts. Partial writes retain the lane until
// their operation can be reused. Additional sends wait in a bounded FIFO.
// Registered regions are retained from admission through logical completion;
// payload bytes remain caller-owned under the generic asynchronous carrier
// contract. Send callbacks return source ownership and may run in a different
// order than the bytes were written.
//
// Receive progress uses one pool-backed operation. A consumer may move a
// receive lease out of its callback. The last available native buffer is
// delivered without a movable lease so retained data cannot block later
// control messages. Framing gives borrowed messages independent storage.

// |proactor| must own |socket| and the registered region backing
// |receive_pool|. The receive region must permit writes and contain at least

// its buffers with another I/O producer would violate lease exclusivity. The
// carrier retains all three resources without consuming the caller's
// references.
//
// The returned carrier begins in CREATED state. Install handlers and activate
// it before sending. The carrier accepts at most
// |options.max_send_operations| sends and at most
// IREE_ASYNC_SOCKET_SEND_MAX_BUFFERS borrowed spans per send. A generated
// prefix does not reduce the accepted borrowed-span count. When the prefix plus
// borrowed spans exceed one physical socket vector the carrier continues the
// same logical send in another socket operation without copying the payload.
