// Arena-owned physical configuration plan awaiting resident materialization.
typedef struct loom_aie2p_configuration_plan_t loom_aie2p_configuration_plan_t;

// Builds a physical configuration plan and its source-known product entry.
//
// The entry names straight-line initialization and invocation functions. Their
// shared Low schedules supply instruction order and operand identities. Binding
// declarations supply complete external extents, including auxiliary services;
// range operands select relocation spans within those extents. Initialization
// loads already complete workers and never adds a firing loop or port protocol.
// Invocation contains runtime-address relocations and explicit completion
// waits. Low verification has established closed signatures, command phases,
// and complete physical worker definitions. Construction admits evaluated
// physical operands against the device profile. Input diagnostics leave
// |out_valid| false and no entry may be consumed; statuses report
// infrastructure failures. Referenced workers are materialized Low definitions:
// source specialization, call expansion and resource binding precede this
// physical form. Their private storage and read-only data are placed alongside
// the resident data ranges.
//
// The amd.xdna.aie2p.configuration representation has three operand classes:
// config.scalar contains exact nonnegative integers, config.binding identifies
// an invocation buffer, and config.span selects bytes relative to that buffer.
// The target assembly instructions have the following semantics:
//
//   constant value : reg<aie2p.config.scalar : i64>
//     Materializes an exact nonnegative scalar used by physical commands.
//   entry columns, @initialize, @invoke
//     Names argument-free configuration functions and the context-relative
//     column footprint. The public retained array_program contains one entry.
//   binding ordinal, access, length, alignment
//     Declares an invocation buffer's complete required extent and base
//     alignment, including auxiliary services. Access is read=1, write=2, or
//     both=3. Ordinals are dense in declaration order. A binding may start at
//     any logical buffer offset satisfying its extent and alignment contract.
//   range binding, offset, length
//     Selects a nonempty byte span within the declared binding extent.
//   write32 address, value; write.mask32 address, mask, value
//   write.block32 (address) [words...]
//     Perform ordered physical writes within one tile's register aperture.
//   wait.mask32 address, mask, value
//     Waits until (register & mask) == value before issuing later commands.
//     The value contains only bits selected by the mask. The wait does not
//     modify the register and is available in initialization and invocation.
//   write.address address, span
//     Writes the span's relocated runtime address as two consecutive words.
//   shim.descriptor address, span, length, flags, dim0, dim1, dim2, iter,
//   control
//     Writes eight shim DMA descriptor words with the span supplying the
//     address bits. Length and other fields use the native register encoding;
//     the span covers every byte reachable by the encoded dimensions.
//   program.load column, row, @worker
//     Loads a complete argument-free core definition during initialization.
//     The configuration keeps the core reset until its state is ready.
//   data.reserve column, row, offset, length
//     Reserves the byte range in that tile's data memory for the configuration
//     lifetime. These ranges hold resident channel data or service state and
//     remain independent of program lifetime. Overlapping declarations reserve
//     their union. They emit no initialization writes and retain existing data.
//     Worker storage and read-only data are packed into the remaining memory.
//     All reservations apply regardless of their order among program loads.
//   dma.wait column, row, direction, channel, columns, rows
//     Waits for task-completion tokens across the explicit rectangular range.
//     Direction is memory-to-stream=1 or stream-to-memory=2.
//
// Initialization executes once; subsequent invocations reuse its state. The
// invocation function supplies external bindings and all relocated writes.
// Configuration functions are statically evaluated straight-line Low programs;
// worker functions retain their complete authored control flow. Each distinct
// worker is named once in the plan and is later compiled once and linked at
// each placement with that tile's data reservations and core-visible address
// apertures.
//
// Building evaluates all configuration functions and retains every fact needed
// for product admission, but does not compile or link resident workers. All
// storage in |out_plan| and |out_entry| belongs to the request's arena.
// Unsupported authored configuration and unresolved physical values leave
// |out_valid| false. Status reports infrastructure failures.
