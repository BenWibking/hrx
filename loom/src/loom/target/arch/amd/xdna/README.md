# AMD XDNA target

Loom compiles tile programs and their array transport into a native `.xdna`
executable. The product contains AIE2P instructions, initialized data, array
configuration, explicit storage and binding requirements, and native invocation
ranges. It executes through [libamdf](../../../../../../../libamdf/docs/xdna/execution.md);
compilation does not invoke the AIE SDK, LLVM, Python, or an external linker.

This directory owns device facts and AIE2P target mechanics. The shared Loom
compiler owns IR analysis, canonicalization, scheduling, register allocation,
and pass lifecycles. The target supplies descriptors, legal realizations,
physical constraints, and native encoding. The experimental pipeline dialect
provides an authoring path for streamed workers; its representation is
provisional and subject to redesign.

## Start here

| Task | Entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Write a streamed program or author AIE2P Low | [Source lowering examples](aie2p/test/source_low/) and [Low descriptor fixtures](aie2p/test/descriptors/) |
| Embed the compiler | [Public XDNA C binding](../../../../../../binding/c/include/loomc/target/amd/xdna.h) |
| Understand the executable contract | [Native image format and lifecycle](../../../../../../../runtime/src/iree/hal/drivers/amd/xdna/image/README.md) |
| Load and execute a compiled image | [Experimental native runner](../../../../../../../experimental/xdna/README.md) |
| Compare compiler work across targets | [Shared benchmark workloads](../../../../../../binding/c/benchmark/kernels/README.md) |

## Target identity

The instruction-set contract and deployment profile answer different questions.
`amd.xdna.aie2p.core` describes a tile function; `amd.xdna.aie2p.array`
describes the workers and transport surrounding those functions. An exact
[device profile](device/profile.h) supplies the geometry, array family,
firmware protocol identity, partition constraints, and native memory alignment.

| Device | Exact compiler profile | PCI device/revision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strix NPU4 | `amd.xdna.strix.17f0_10` | `17f0:10` |
| Strix Halo NPU5 | `amd.xdna.strix_halo.17f0_11` | `17f0:11` |

Both profiles use the NPU2 array family and AIE2P cores. This does not make their
executable images interchangeable: admission compares the exact profile,
revision, firmware ABI, and context geometry. Tile memory, DMA engines, locks,
stream switches, register fields, and instruction limits come from owned
profile and family tables rather than assumptions about one attached device.

The [pipeline lowering](aie2p/pipeline/lower.h) consumes composition relations
and materializes workers, channels, and entry bindings. A logical group names
participants; physical placement and transport are decisions of the array
plan. Consumers use the indexed relations retained by their producers.

The [array plan](aie2p/array/plan.h) owns worker placement, endpoint storage,
ring slots, locks, DMA channels and buffer descriptors, stream routes, and
completion resources. It selects external DMA, adjacent shared-memory windows,
or routed DMA according to the communication pattern and physical constraints.
[Resident scheduling](aie2p/array/resident.h) and
[program emission](aie2p/array/program.h) turn that plan into device behavior.
Emitters consume the selected resources without independently allocating a DMA
channel or recovering topology from native bytes.

For a core, common Low machinery handles dependence scheduling and physical
allocation. The target's [bundle planner](aie2p/emit/bundle_plan.h) applies
AIE2P slots, hazards, timing, and encoding constraints. The result fits the
selected tile's instruction and data budgets; code growth is a physical
resource cost, not just a compile-time statistic.

## Detached leaves and placement

[Leaf compilation](aie2p/emit/leaf_compile.h) returns a
[detached contribution](aie2p/emit/leaf_object.h): native sections, symbols,
fixups, and exact realization facts. It retains no compiler IR or temporary
planning references. Temporary scheduling and allocation storage returns to
the arena block pool before the leaf compiler returns.

The realization records code and data extents, function-storage requirements,
resource imports and their physical register bindings, capability bits, and
the union of physical register units written by the final native program.
That union includes implicit writes and generated moves across CFG paths.
`loom_aie2p_leaf_may_write_register` lets placement and linking prove that an
absent register unit is preserved without inspecting the leaf again.

Fixed-value constraints describe locations over SSA live intervals, including
values live through the exit. This provides an explicit boundary between
independent leaf compilation and its surrounding program. The
[tile linker](aie2p/emit/tile_link.h) binds placement-dependent storage and
resources using these retained facts. It does not deserialize a worker ELF or
recompile a leaf to discover its requirements.

Python generators normalize the owned data into compact C tables consumed by
the shipping compiler. Pinned vendor extraction oracles support table
maintenance and differential checks; they are not a runtime compiler dependency.
Checked-in C headers define the interfaces and representation invariants.

## Executable production and residency

[Product emission](aie2p/emit/xdna_product.h) serializes the already selected
plan as load ranges and compact indexed tables. Identical file payloads can
initialize several destinations through exact source aliases. An allocation
requirement describes storage; each exported entry selects the allocations it
uses. Loading applies static address fixups, and binding applies external
buffer addresses to explicitly declared fields.

Invocation zero establishes resident state. The current finite protocol then
uses a continuation range for repeated work (`0 -> 1 -> 1`) while the context,
backing, and residency remain intact. The format also represents a self-contained
range (`0 -> 0`). Program shards and role changes within an invocation are
compiled device behavior, not a mandatory host dispatch per tile function.

The format has no fixed ARRAY/CONTROL split, XRT argument-patching contract, or
precompiled PDI dependency. libamdf owns device/context establishment and family
bootstrap. Loom owns the executable protocol, and the caller owns its completion
frontier and backing lifetime. The [image specification](../../../../../../../runtime/src/iree/hal/drivers/amd/xdna/image/README.md)
defines this boundary precisely.

## Support and evidence

Low exposes instruction families beyond those selected automatically from High,
including integer and floating matrix forms, BFP operations, cascade transfers,
lookup memory, dimensional addressing, FIFO forms, and post-increment memory
access. The [descriptor fixtures](aie2p/test/descriptors/) identify the supported
forms and operand contracts. Hand-authored Low still obeys explicit hardware
state and ordering contracts; it does not authorize arbitrary instruction
permutation.

High support is determined by the legalizations and
[source-to-Low fixtures](aie2p/test/source_low/). An available Low instruction
does not imply a numerically conforming High lowering. For example, strict
BF16 multiplication requires a conforming realization; the compiler rejects
unsupported cases instead of silently changing floating-point behavior.

Compiler transformations and diagnostics are exercised through `.loom-test`
fixtures. C tests cover API and representation contracts. The
[native consumer CTS](../../../../../../../experimental/xdna/cts) verifies real loading,
binding, repeated execution, numerical outputs, and resource lifetimes through
libamdf on matching hardware. The [BF16 FFN benchmark](../../../../../../binding/c/benchmark/kernels/ffn/gate_up_quadratic_bf16_xdna.loom)
provides a small High-to-image workload comparable to the AMDGPU implementation;
its benchmark measures compilation, not device throughput.
