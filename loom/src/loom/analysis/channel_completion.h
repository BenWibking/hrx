// Each direction has one cursor owner; selection establishes this separately.
//
// A later completion produces no credit until its predecessors complete. The
// final completion of that prefix exposes all its records. Wait borrows an
// already acquired read without changing the frontier. Obligation names
// rotate simultaneously across CFG arguments, so loop-carried records need no
// absolute sequence numbers. Compatible incoming states share constant credit
// deltas; incompatible states require runtime record identity/frontier state.
//
// Deferred reader reclamation cannot cross another channel admission: delaying
// those credits could introduce a wait cycle that independently reusable slots
// would avoid. Such programs require a different physical realization. Ordinary
// payload operations cannot acquire channels through a hidden side channel.
// This proof establishes neither payload visibility nor DMA completion; the
// selected transport and asynchronous-access analysis own those contracts.
//
// Status carries allocation failure. Requirements describe valid source needing
// another realization. No target diagnostics or source mutations occur here.
// No-action workers allocate nothing. Other state lives in arena through the
// consuming rewrite; emission uses the direct action-indexed result table.
