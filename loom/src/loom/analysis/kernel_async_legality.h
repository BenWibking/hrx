// Kernel async stream legality analysis.

// This analysis proves kernel.async group/wait streams are in the
// straight-line form required by target lowering. Local op verifiers check
// token types, known footprints, and cache policies; this analysis requires
// concrete transfer footprints and endpoint memory spaces from propagated
// facts, and checks the temporal stream contract that depends on program order.
