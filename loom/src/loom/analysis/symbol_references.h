// Rebuildable module symbol reference table.
//
// This analysis is the canonical symbol-use substrate for module-level
// analyses. It records occurrences from the symbol whose definition owns
// an operation to each module-local symbol referenced by that operation, nested
// attributes, static encoding attributes, and each SSA value definition's
// type. The table is intentionally rebuilt from immutable IR instead of
// maintained on every IR mutation path; callers that rewrite symbols should
// rebuild after mutation.
