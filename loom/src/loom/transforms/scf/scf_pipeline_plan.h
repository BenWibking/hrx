// Ordinary reads and their transitive payload prerequisites form the producer.
// When the body has ordered memory effects, only proven global loads move;
// workgroup accesses and workgroup barriers stay in the ordered consumer with
// the carried recurrence. |spaces| retains the owning analysis's
// classifications across nested reconstruction without borrowing its
// invalidated fact table. Nested scf.if/scf.for operations remain intact within
// their assigned stage. Convergent units and workgroup memory effects stay in
// the consumer when |has_static_bounds| proves exact lower and upper bounds.
// Along with the caller's exact positive step, this preserves participants
// across the serial/main/drain split. The plan owns the complete cut, including
// values referenced only by types or attributes. Materializers and reports
// consume this cut directly.
// Queued index add/sub results are reconstructed in the consumer when their
// complete prerequisites are already available there. This removes redundant
// queue entries and keeps their arithmetic relationship to other queued values.
//
// The admission contract excludes other nested control, global/unknown writes,
// global fences, source-order constraints, mixed producer/consumer units,
// producers depending on carried state, and cross-stage values whose types vary
// with the iteration. Convergence in a read unit or prerequisite cannot move
// into the producer. Rejections identify the source requirement;
// status failures identify allocation or representation limits. Plan storage
// belongs to |arena| and borrows the source IR until reconstruction completes.
