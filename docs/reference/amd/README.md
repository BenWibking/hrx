# AMD hardware reference

This is an **unofficial guide**, assembled through best-effort reverse
engineering and distillation of publicly available repositories and
documentation, together with our own experiments. It is not an official AMD
specification and uses no confidential or non-public vendor material.

Correctness and completeness are not guaranteed. Citations and experimental
results provide evidence for the specific behavior and conditions they cover;
they do not establish correctness on other hardware, firmware, driver or
software configurations.

This reference describes AMD hardware and firmware programming: command and
register representations, execution ordering, memory visibility, resource
lifetime, and architecture-specific behavior. Native driver interfaces and
upstream runtime implementations supply the context needed to use those
mechanisms on a particular platform.

| Area | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| [GPU](gpu/README.md) | Command processors, transfer engines, and their memory and signaling protocols. |
| [XDNA](xdna/README.md) | AI Engine array execution, DMA, interconnects, firmware commands, and observation. |
| [CPU, GPU and NPU interop](interop/README.md) | Every directed memory handoff, external API sharing, resident credits, composed pipelines and final reuse. |
| [Sources](sources.md) | Architecture specifications, immutable implementation revisions, and the role of each source. |
| [Writing guide](STYLE.md) | Chapter structure, terminology, evidence, and citation conventions. |

Each mechanism carries its own architecture, firmware, transport, and memory
conditions. A compiler target, physical engine revision, operating-system
interface, and runtime policy describe different parts of that applicability.
Where sources disagree, the affected fields and source-specific interpretations
remain explicit.

## Programming tasks

The family indexes organize the hardware mechanisms. These routes start from
the operation a native caller needs to perform; packet and register names also
provide exact search terms within the tree.
