# PM4 compute commands

PM4 is the command processor's packet language. A compute stream binds shader
state, launches work, moves data, and establishes dependencies between execution
stages and memory clients. The stream's transport also owns its address space,
queue context, publication protocol, and command-storage lifetime. Those facts
are not encoded by an opcode alone.

This section follows ordinary MEC compute callers in PAL, Mesa and Linux/KFD.
ME and PFP forms are identified separately where the packet or ordering rules
differ. PAL's `gfx9` source directory contains definitions for later generations;
the directory name is not an architecture predicate. [Packet definitions][packets]
[Generation predicates][generations]

## Programming sequence

A complete compute operation has several owners:

1. The native queue owner establishes the process VM, scheduling context and
   runtime-controlled shader state.
2. The program owner supplies a compatible executable, its complete readable
   fetch extent, resource requirements and initial-register ABI.
3. The submission owner makes command bytes, arguments and input data visible
   before publishing the queue or indirect-buffer reference.
4. The command processor binds the program and launches work. Dependencies join
   the actual producer stage before applying the required cache operations.
5. A completion protocol publishes a result to its intended observer. Command
   consumption and the last dependent consumer separately determine which
   storage can be reused.

PAL's compute postamble illustrates why the distinctions matter: it drains
outstanding CP DMA and, when command-storage busy tracking is enabled, waits
for shaders that may access command memory before incrementing the tracker.
That tracker relies on a subsequent KMD cache-flushing EOP in PAL's scheduled
submission path. With tracking disabled, the client owns completion before
returning storage. A raw user ring has no implicit right to PAL's native
trailer. [Compute postamble][postamble]

[Architecture identity](../architectures.md) distinguishes compiler targets,
native IP versions and firmware. [AQL](../aql/README.md) and
[SDMA](../sdma/README.md) are different packet/transport contracts; sharing a
memory allocation does not make their completion or cache operations
interchangeable. [Programming recipes](../recipes/README.md) compose those
contracts across actors.

## Interpreting the source

A packet definition establishes representation. A builder selects fields. A
caller establishes the execution sequence, and the allocation/submission owner
establishes publication and retirement. The chapters keep those layers visible.
They also retain disagreements: MEC and graphics ACQUIRE_MEM range widths,
PAL and Mesa DMA completion conventions, and metadata-cache policies cannot be
resolved merely by choosing a familiar packet name.

Execution completion, write confirmation, cache visibility, notification and
command retirement answer different questions. In particular, an instruction
cache invalidate does not retire an older shader, a memory wait does not by
itself acquire payload caches, and a queue read pointer is not a shader result.
The applicable generation, engine, firmware and mapping predicates belong to
each complete sequence. [Compute waits][idle] [Cache-only acquire][acquire]
