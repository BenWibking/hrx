# GPU programming

AMD GPUs expose command-processing and transfer engines with distinct packet
representations, execution boundaries, and cache responsibilities. A command
stream combines these mechanisms with the native queue's publication and
resource-lifetime protocol.

Compiler target, physical graphics/compute IP, SDMA IP, firmware, and native
transport identify different parts of a programming contract. The operation
chapters retain those conditions beside the packet fields and sequences they
govern.
