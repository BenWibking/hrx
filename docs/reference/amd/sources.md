# Primary sources

The reference combines architecture and ABI definitions with firmware-facing
packet layouts, native drivers, and upstream consumers. Each chapter cites the
specific definition, builder, caller, or resource owner that supports a claim.

HSA's [System Architecture 1.2][hsa-system] defines standard AQL packets,
publication, signal, and fence-scope semantics. Its [Programmer's Reference
Manual 1.2][hsa-prm] supplies work-item and workgroup execution rules. AMD's
[GPU architecture documentation index][gpu-manuals] locates individual ISA
manuals; shader instructions and command-processor packets have separate
representations and owners.

AMD's [Sea Islands 3D/Compute Register Reference Guide, revision 1.0,
19 September 2012][cik-registers], pp. 196–200, describes legacy dispatch
geometry and initiator controls. The [dispatch chapter](gpu/pm4/dispatch.md#initiator-field-family)
separates those meanings from later source layouts and actual caller policy;
the older cache and context fields are not a substitute for a newer native
publication or scheduling protocol.

The [RDNA4 ISA guide, 7 April 2025][rdna4-isa], §5.7 and Table 26, supplies
the architecture's dependency-counter rules used in the
[shader wait-mode discussion](gpu/pm4/dispatch.md#shader-wait-counter-mode-mem_ordered).

The [CDNA5 ISA guide, 27 July 2026][cdna5-isa], covers cache policy in
§§4.1.1–2, barriers in §5.6, dependency counters in §5.7, asynchronous memory
in §10.8, tensor movement in §10.11 and LDS split barriers in §11.2.2. The
[architecture map](gpu/architectures.md#cdna5-and-gfx1250) connects its naming
to public compiler and native-driver sources.

GPUOpen's [6 August 2026 machine-readable ISA archive][isa-xml] contains
`amdgpu_isa_cdna5.xml`, whose document revision is 3 August 2026 and schema
version is 1.2.0. Its instruction definitions provide a second representation
of the cache and wait operations; the descriptions and manual are both AMD
sources, rather than independent hardware observations.

AMD's [Micro Engine Scheduler specification, April 2024][mes-manual],
introduced by GPUOpen as an RDNA3 scheduling overview, describes the native
MES API and its scheduling fields. Its `ADD_QUEUE` flags corroborate the
[cooperative-launch discussion](gpu/cooperative.md#what-reaches-the-scheduler);
that revision does not establish the behavior of later MES implementations.

Microsoft's public [D3D12 sharing][d3d12-sharing] and [queue synchronization][d3d12-sync]
documentation supplies the API contracts for shared heaps, resources and
fences. Those object and execution contracts complement the native Windows
DDI; neither defines a device-specific NPU import protocol. The external-memory
chapter cites the particular creation, residency, mapping and completion APIs.

The AI Engine chapters also use AMD's AM020 and AM027 architecture manuals,
the AM025 register manual, UG1079 kernel coding guide, UG1603 revision 2026.1
for managed GMIO and external-memory dataflow, and the versioned
2025.1/2026.1 intrinsic references.
Each chapter identifies the relevant document, section, architecture, and
toolchain version.
Those architecture manuals do not by themselves establish how a native host
driver exposes the same mechanism.

Arm's [AMBA AXI and ACE specification IHI 0022F.b][axi4] defines the AXI4
transaction attributes, response ordering and single-copy atomicity used in
the array's external-memory discussion. The array and host integration
determine where those protocol observations meet another device's memory
and cache path.

Several consumers can share the same generated packet definition or delegate
to the same runtime. Agreement along that chain corroborates the caller flow;
it is not independent evidence about the underlying representation. A driver
submission wrapper can supply operations absent from the command buffer it
executes. The corresponding chapter identifies those boundaries.
